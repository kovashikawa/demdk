## short description:

your company provides a feature that allows users to schedule recurring allowances, enabling them to set a specific amount and periodicity (`daily`, `weekly`, `biweekly`, or `monthly`) for payments. the backend process responsible for updating the systemâ€™s allowance and payment schedule tables encountered issues, leading to discrepancies in the `next_payment_day` fields across datasets.

you are given data reflecting all recorded events and backend table states up to `2024-12-03`. your task is to analyze the data and report inconsistencies.

available datasets:
![database schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-repo/main/path-to-your-image.png)

task

using the allowance_events dataset as the source of truth, analyze the data and identify inconsistencies in next_payment_day and payment_date. create a detailed report describing:
	â€¢	discrepancies in the backend tables
	â€¢	patterns in the errors
	â€¢	potential causes and scope of the problem

evaluation criteria

your submission will be evaluated on:
	1.	report quality
	â€¢	clarity and depth in describing the findings
	â€¢	accuracy in identifying discrepancies and patterns
	â€¢	logical reasoning and structure
	2.	code quality
	â€¢	cleanliness, organization, and documentation
	â€¢	correctness and efficiency in analysis
	â€¢	appropriate use of tools and methods

ideally, share your code via a github repository for structured review.

good luck! ðŸš€
