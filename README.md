# demdk - data engineering @ modak
> this repo consists of a technical exercise for the data engineering position at [modak](https://modak.na.teamtailor.com/)

the complete exercise description can be found at the [data-challenge.pdf](https://github.com/kovashikawa/demdk/blob/main/data-challenge.pdf)

the solution and presentation is located at [demdk.ipynb](https://github.com/kovashikawa/demdk/blob/main/demdk.ipynb)

## short description

your company provides a feature that allows users to schedule recurring allowances, enabling them to set a specific amount and periodicity (`daily`, `weekly`, `biweekly`, or `monthly`) for payments. the backend process responsible for updating the systemâ€™s allowance and payment schedule tables encountered issues, leading to discrepancies in the `next_payment_day` fields across datasets.

you are given data reflecting all recorded events and backend table states up to `2024-12-03`. your task is to analyze the data and report inconsistencies.

available datasets:

### task

using the `allowance_events` dataset as the source of truth, analyze the data and identify inconsistencies in `next_payment_day` and `payment_date`. create a detailed report describing:
	â€¢	discrepancies in the backend tables
	â€¢	patterns in the errors
	â€¢	potential causes and scope of the problem

## findings

you can see the main findings at the [demdk.ipynb](https://github.com/kovashikawa/demdk/blob/main/demdk.ipynb).

there we can find plots and data explaining were the errors were mostly concentrated and possible bugs outside the scope of this exercise.

in summary, we can say that most of the errors were find in the `biweekly` and `weekly` frequencies. this means that is almost certain that we will find bugs in the backend code that made these updates:

![freq_error_plot](https://github.com/kovashikawa/demdk/blob/main/images/freq_error.png?raw=true)

it is worth mentioning that:

* errors in the `daily` frequency are mostly because the table was not updated on the `CURRENT_DATE = 2024-12-03`
* `biweekly` concentrated most of the errors, followed by the `weekly`
* single `monthly` is caused by similar issue on the relations of events logs, not the single one caused by this, as pointed out in the notebook

for the logic of this code I made a few assumptions, as that the `biweekly` frequency is supposed to be paid on the 1st and 3rd week of the month
